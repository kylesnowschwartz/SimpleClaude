FFS! You just did something dumb again.

Here are some common mistakes you make:

1. Not following the rules outlined in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
2. Pretending to know something you don't actually know.
3. Coding or committing without permission.
4. You said something works without confirming that first. Show (e.g. by running tests), don't just tell.
5. You didn't follow established coding standards or patterns.
