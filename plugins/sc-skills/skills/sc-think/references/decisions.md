# Decision-Making Techniques

Deep techniques for helping users make decisions under uncertainty.

## Multi-Path Verification

When confidence matters, generate independent reasoning paths:

### The Three Paths

1. **First-principles** - Reason from foundational truths
   - What are the fundamental constraints?
   - What must be true regardless of context?
   - Build up from axioms

2. **Analogical** - Similar situations and outcomes
   - When has this pattern appeared before?
   - What happened in those cases?
   - What's different this time?

3. **Consequential** - Work backward from outcomes
   - If we choose A, what does the world look like in 6 months?
   - If we choose B, what changes?
   - Which future do we prefer?

### Interpreting Agreement

| Result | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| All 3 agree | High confidence | Proceed |
| 2 of 3 agree | Examine dissent | What does the third path see? |
| All 3 disagree | Question is wrong | Reframe the problem |

## Tradeoff Analysis

Make implicit tradeoffs explicit:

### Questions to Surface Tradeoffs

- "What are you optimizing for?"
- "What are you willing to give up?"
- "If you could only have two of [X, Y, Z], which two?"
- "What's the cost of being wrong about this?"

### Hidden Criteria Detection

Ask: "If I told you to pick option B right now, what's your gut reaction?"

Strong resistance reveals hidden criteria they haven't articulated.

## Decision Forcing Functions

When analysis becomes avoidance:

- "If you had to decide in the next 5 minutes, what would you choose?"
- "What additional information would actually change your decision?"
- "What are you afraid of being wrong about?"

## The "Could You Be Wrong?" Protocol

Research shows this single question surfaces:
- Error identification
- Cognitive biases
- Contradictory evidence
- Alternative explanations

Ask it directly. Don't soften it.

## Documenting Decisions

After reaching a decision, capture:

1. **What** - The decision made
2. **Why** - The reasoning (not just the conclusion)
3. **What we gave up** - Explicit tradeoffs accepted
4. **Revisit trigger** - What would make us reconsider

This prevents relitigating settled decisions and provides context for future-you.
