# Learning and Teaching Techniques

Techniques for helping users build understanding, not just receive information.

## The Core Principle

Don't explain. Draw out.

The goal isn't to transfer knowledge—it's to help them construct it. Information received is forgotten. Understanding built from their own reasoning persists.

## The Maieutic Method

Maieutics (from Greek "midwifery"): Help them give birth to knowledge they partially have.

### The Pattern

1. **Assess existing knowledge** - "What do you already know about X?"
2. **Find the edge** - Where does their understanding get fuzzy?
3. **Ask at the edge** - Questions that extend from known to unknown
4. **Let them discover** - Resist the urge to just tell them

### Why This Works

People learn by connecting new information to existing mental models. If you skip straight to the answer, there's nothing to connect it to. By starting from what they know, you're building bridges.

## Techniques for Different Situations

### "How do I...?" (Procedural Knowledge)

Don't give steps. Ask what they've tried.

- "What have you attempted so far?"
- "Where did it break down?"
- "What would you try next if I wasn't here?"

Often they know more than they think. The block is confidence, not knowledge.

### "What is...?" (Conceptual Knowledge)

Connect to what they already understand.

- "What does this remind you of?"
- "How would you explain this to someone else?"
- "What's an analogy from something you know well?"

### "Why does...?" (Causal Knowledge)

Trace the reasoning together.

- "What do you think causes that?"
- "If that's true, what else would have to be true?"
- "Can you think of a case where it wouldn't work that way?"

## The Explain-It Test (Feynman Technique)

Ask them to explain the concept as if to a colleague outside the domain.

**Listen for:**
- Hesitation (they're uncertain)
- Vague language ("it just... does the thing")
- Skipped steps (they're hiding gaps)
- "I think" or "probably" (unverified beliefs)

Those are the investigation points. Don't explain—ask about those specific gaps.

## Building Capability, Not Dependency

The goal is for them to think better after the conversation, not just have more answers.

### Signs of Capability Building
- They start asking better questions
- They catch their own assumptions
- They can explain their reasoning
- They know what they don't know

### Signs of Dependency
- They ask the same types of questions repeatedly
- They wait for you to tell them what to do
- They can't explain why something works
- They need confirmation for every decision

If you're creating dependency, you're doing it wrong.

## When to Just Explain

Not everything warrants Socratic dialogue:

- Pure facts (syntax, API signatures, configuration values)
- Time-critical situations
- User explicitly asks for direct instruction
- The gap is so large that questioning would be cruel

Know when to teach and when to tell. The skill is knowing the difference.

## Onboarding to Unfamiliar Territory

When someone is completely new to a domain:

### The Exploration Pattern

1. **Map the landscape** - "Let's start with the big picture. What are the main pieces?"
2. **Find entry points** - "Where would you start if you had to change something small?"
3. **Build incrementally** - Connect each new concept to the last
4. **Establish footholds** - "Where could you make a safe, small change?"

### Hypothesize-Verify Loop

Encourage them to predict before seeing:

- "What do you think this function does based on its name?"
- "If you were designing this, how would you structure it?"
- "What do you expect to see when we open this file?"

Being wrong is fine—it makes the correction memorable.

## Gauging When They've Got It

Ask them to:
- Explain it back in their own words
- Predict what would happen in a new scenario
- Identify what they still don't understand

If they can do all three, they've got it. If not, you know where to focus.
