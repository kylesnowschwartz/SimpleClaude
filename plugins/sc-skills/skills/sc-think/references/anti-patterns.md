# Socratic Anti-Patterns

Failure modes that undermine dialectical thinking. Check yourself against these.

## Socratic Theater

**Symptom**: Going through the motions of questioning without genuine inquiry. Asking "What are your assumptions?" as a ritual, not because you're curious.

**Why it happens**: Following a script instead of engaging with the actual situation.

**Fix**: Ask yourself: "Am I actually curious about their answer?" If not, you're performing, not thinking.

**Test**: Would their answer change your next question? If any answer leads to the same follow-up, you're in theater mode.

## Infinite Refinement Loop

**Symptom**: Endless questioning without reaching closure. "But what about..." forever.

**Why it happens**: Confusing thoroughness with progress. Fear of committing to a direction.

**Fix**: Set explicit decision points. "After we examine X, we'll decide." Time-box exploration.

**Test**: Can you articulate what would constitute "enough" analysis? If not, you'll never get there.

## Answer Extraction

**Symptom**: Asking leading questions to guide them to your predetermined answer. Socratic method as manipulation.

**Why it happens**: You already know what you think they should do. The questions are theater to get buy-in.

**Fix**: If you have a recommendation, state it directly. Don't pretend to discover it together.

**Test**: Are you genuinely open to being persuaded by their reasoning? If not, stop asking questions and make your case.

## Vacuum Questioning

**Symptom**: Abstract philosophical questions disconnected from the actual situation. "What does success mean to you?" when they're debugging a null pointer.

**Why it happens**: Defaulting to generic frameworks instead of engaging with specifics.

**Fix**: Ground every question in actual code, files, or concrete context. Read before you ask.

**Test**: Does your question reference something specific to their situation? If it could apply to anyone, it's probably too abstract.

## Question Fatigue

**Symptom**: User becomes frustrated, disengaged, or just wants an answer. You've exhausted their patience.

**Why it happens**: Socratic dialogue is effortful. Not every situation warrants it.

**Fix**: Read the room. If they want execution, execute. Ask: "Would you like me to think through this with you, or just give you my recommendation?"

**Test**: Are they leaning in or pulling back? Engaged answers vs. terse responses.

## Assumption Overload

**Symptom**: Surfacing so many assumptions that the user is overwhelmed. Analysis paralysis induced by the helper.

**Why it happens**: Thoroughness without prioritization. Every assumption seems worth examining.

**Fix**: Identify the 2-3 load-bearing assumptions. Ignore the rest until those are resolved.

**Test**: If you fixed this one assumption, would the others matter? Focus there.

## Premature Closure

**Symptom**: Accepting the first reasonable answer and moving on. Not probing beneath the surface.

**Why it happens**: Desire to be helpful and make progress. Discomfort with uncertainty.

**Fix**: Ask one more question after you think you understand. "What else?" often surfaces the real issue.

**Test**: Did you explore alternatives, or just validate their initial framing?

## Recovery Protocol

When you catch yourself in an anti-pattern:

1. **Name it** - "I notice I'm doing X"
2. **Reset** - "Let me step back"
3. **Reground** - Return to concrete context
4. **Redirect** - Apply a different technique

It's fine to catch yourself mid-conversation. The meta-awareness is the point.
