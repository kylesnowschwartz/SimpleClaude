# SimpleClaude Documentation

## Overview

SimpleClaude is a practical minimalist AI assistant framework that transforms complex AI interactions into natural conversations through specialized agents. It consolidates 19+ commands into 5 intuitive commands that understand plain English.

## Core Philosophy

### Surface Simplicity, Deep Power

- Simple natural language interface
- Advanced capabilities emerge when needed
- Zero configuration for basic usage
- Complexity available through context, not flags

### Practical Minimalism

- Focus on real-world development patterns
- Adapt to projects, don't prescribe rules
- Keep it simple, but not simplistic
- Every feature must earn its place

## The 5 Commands

### `/sc-create` - Universal Creation

Transforms natural language into creation workflows:

- "a React component for user auth" → Component generation
- "API documentation" → Documentation creation
- "a new project with TypeScript" → Project scaffolding

### `/sc-modify` - Intelligent Modification

Understands improvement intent:

- "improve performance" → Performance optimization
- "refactor for clarity" → Code cleanup
- "migrate to v2" → Version migration

### `/sc-understand` - Deep Analysis

Explains and visualizes:

- "how authentication works" → Step-by-step explanation
- "the architecture" → Visual system design
- "performance bottlenecks" → Comprehensive analysis

### `/sc-fix` - Focused Resolution

Solves problems intelligently:

- Error messages → Debug workflow
- "git is broken" → Git problem resolution
- "tests are failing" → Test fixing

### `/sc-review` - Quality Assurance

Comprehensive quality checks:

- "security vulnerabilities" → Security audit
- "test coverage" → Test analysis
- "code quality" → Best practices review

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create anything with natural language
/sc-create a React component for user authentication

# Modify code intelligently
/sc-modify improve performance of database queries

# Understand complex codebases
/sc-understand how does the payment system work

# Fix issues quickly
/sc-fix TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined

# Review code quality
/sc-review check for security vulnerabilities
```

No flags. No configuration. Just describe what you need.

## Key Innovations

### Natural Language Detection

No flags needed - just describe what you want:

- Keywords trigger appropriate modes
- Context enhances understanding
- Ambiguity prompts clarification
- Modifiers blend behaviors

#### The 5 Lightweight Agents

1. **context-analyzer** - Maps project structure, technology stack, and existing patterns
2. **context7-documentation-specialist** - Retrieves current, accurate documentation for libraries and frameworks
3. **repo-documentation-finder** - Finds up-to-date documentation from official GitHub repositories
4. **test-runner** - Runs tests and analyzes failures without making fixes
5. **web-search-researcher** - Searches web for current information and research

Each agent is lightweight, focused, and designed for maximum token efficiency in its domain.

## Design Principles

1. **Discoverability First**: New users productive in minutes
2. **Context-Aware Intelligence**: Adapts to your project automatically
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Advanced features emerge when needed
4. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: All suggestions backed by analysis
5. **Fail Fast, Fix Fast**: Clear errors with actionable solutions

## What Makes SimpleClaude Different?

### From SuperClaude

- 19 commands → 5 commands
- Flag combinations → Natural language
- Manual configuration → Auto-detection
- Rigid personas → Adaptive modes
- 150+ line commands → 60 line commands
- Heavyweight framework files → Lightweight agents
- Complex YAML loading → Clean Task() delegation

### From Traditional Tools

- No memorizing command syntax
- No reading extensive documentation
- No complex configuration files
- No artificial limitations
- Just describe what you need

## Agent Architecture Complete

SimpleClaude's agent-based architecture is ready for real-world testing! All core features are implemented:

- ✅ Natural language understanding
- ✅ Automatic mode detection
- ✅ Zero configuration required
- ✅ **Lightweight agent system**: 5 focused agents handle specific tasks
- ✅ **Token efficiency**: Isolated agent contexts prevent bloat
- ✅ **Clean Task() delegation**: Commands orchestrate, agents execute
