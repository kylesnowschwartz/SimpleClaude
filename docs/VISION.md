# SimpleClaude Vision

## What is SimpleClaude?

SimpleClaude is a practical minimalist AI assistant framework that transforms complex AI interactions into natural conversations. It includes 5 intuitive commands that understand plain English.

## Core Philosophy

### Surface Simplicity, Deep Power

- Simple natural language interface
- Advanced capabilities emerge when needed
- Zero configuration for basic usage
- Complexity available through context, not flags

### Practical Minimalism

- Focus on real-world development patterns
- Adapt to projects, don't prescribe rules
- Keep it simple, but not simplistic
- Every feature must earn its place

## The 5 Commands

### `/sc-create` - Universal Creation

Transforms natural language into creation workflows:

- "a React component for user auth" → Component generation
- "API documentation" → Documentation creation
- "a new project with TypeScript" → Project scaffolding

### `/sc-modify` - Intelligent Modification

Understands improvement intent:

- "improve performance" → Performance optimization
- "refactor for clarity" → Code cleanup
- "migrate to v2" → Version migration

### `/sc-understand` - Deep Analysis

Explains and visualizes:

- "how authentication works" → Step-by-step explanation
- "the architecture" → Visual system design
- "performance bottlenecks" → Comprehensive analysis

### `/sc-fix` - Focused Resolution

Solves problems intelligently:

- Error messages → Debug workflow
- "git is broken" → Git problem resolution
- "tests are failing" → Test fixing

### `/sc-review` - Quality Assurance

Comprehensive quality checks:

- "security vulnerabilities" → Security audit
- "test coverage" → Test analysis
- "code quality" → Best practices review

## Key Innovations

### 3-Mode System

3 adaptive modes:

1. **Planner**: Research-focused, asks clarifying questions
2. **Implementer**: Action-oriented, builds solutions
3. **Tester**: Quality-focused, ensures robustness

### Natural Language Detection

No flags needed - just describe what you want:

- Keywords trigger appropriate modes
- Context enhances understanding
- Ambiguity prompts clarification
- Modifiers blend behaviors

### Token-Efficient Architecture

- Heavy use of sub-agents for parallel processing
- Focused main conversation thread
- Smart context isolation
- Efficient result synthesis

## Design Principles

1. **Discoverability First**: New users productive in minutes
2. **Context-Aware Intelligence**: Adapts to your project automatically
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Advanced features emerge when needed
4. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: All suggestions backed by analysis
5. **Fail Fast, Fix Fast**: Clear errors with actionable solutions

## What Makes SimpleClaude Different?
