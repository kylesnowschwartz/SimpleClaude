# SimpleClaude Documentation

## Overview

SimpleClaude is a practical minimalist AI assistant framework that transforms complex AI interactions into natural conversations through specialized agents. Features 4+1 intent-based commands that understand user goals and orchestrate intelligent workflows.

## Core Philosophy

- Simple natural language interface
- Zero configuration for basic usage
- Complexity available through context, not flags
- Focus on real-world development patterns

## The 4+1 Intent-Based Commands

### `/sc-plan` - Strategic Planning 

"I need to think through something" - Analysis and roadmap creation:

### `/sc-work` - Universal Implementation

"I need to build/fix/modify something" - All implementation work:

### `/sc-explore` - Research and Understanding

"I need to understand something" - Investigation and knowledge synthesis:

### `/sc-review` - Quality Verification

"I need to verify quality/security/performance" - Comprehensive assessment:

### `/sc-workflow` - Structured Development

"I need structured, resumable task execution" - Enterprise methodology:

## What Makes SimpleClaude Different?

### From Previous Architectures

- 19 commands → 4+1 intent-based commands
- Task-based → Intent-based philosophy
- Flag combinations → Natural language goals
- Manual configuration → Auto-detection
- Rigid command boundaries → Flexible intent routing
- Heavyweight frameworks → Lightweight agent orchestration
- Complex configuration → Clean Task() delegation

### From Traditional Tools

- No memorizing command syntax
- No reading extensive documentation
- No complex configuration files
- No artificial limitations
- Just describe what you need
