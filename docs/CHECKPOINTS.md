# SimpleClaude Development Checkpoints

## Phase 1: Setup Simple-Claude Structure ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Achievements

- ✅ Created SimpleClaude directory structure with clear namespace separation
- ✅ Consolidated 24+ SuperClaude YAML files into 4 focused SimpleClaude files (~80% reduction)
- ✅ Created SIMPLE.md configuration under 1000 tokens (achieved: ~850 tokens)
- ✅ Simplified 9 personas into 3 adaptive modes (Planner, Implementer, Tester)
- ✅ Preserved @include reference system for compatibility
- ✅ Established `sc-` prefix convention for commands
- ✅ Created foundation for natural language command interface
- ✅ Maintained all essential SuperClaude functionality

### Files Created

- `.claude/SIMPLE.md` - Main configuration
- `.claude/commands/simpleclaude/README.md` - Command documentation
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/core-patterns.yml` - Essential patterns
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/modes.yml` - 3 adaptive modes
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/workflows.yml` - Common workflows
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/context-detection.yml` - Smart defaults
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/README.md` - Pattern documentation

### Technical Decisions

- Used sub-agents for high-context YAML consolidation work
- Maintained backward compatibility with SuperClaude patterns
- Focused on token efficiency through strategic consolidation
- Created clear separation between SimpleClaude and user customizations

### Ready for Next Phase

Foundation established for creating 5 consolidated commands that route to existing SuperClaude logic.

## Phase 1 Iteration: Feedback Implementation ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Feedback Addressed

- ✅ Fixed YAML syntax - removed markdown tables, ensured proper formatting
- ✅ Removed out-of-scope documentation references (reports/tasks/checkpoints)
- ✅ Git conventions now detect existing patterns rather than prescribe
- ✅ File extensions inferred from project context, not hardcoded
- ✅ Session management corrected to use Claude Code commands (/compact, /clear)
- ✅ MCP servers simplified to Context7 (essential) and magic-mcp (optional)
- ✅ Removed compression flags in favor of sub-agent delegation
- ✅ Shifted philosophy to "adapt don't prescribe"

### Key Improvements

- All YAML files now have proper, parseable syntax
- Patterns focus on smart detection over configuration
- Reduced configuration overhead
- Better alignment with SimpleClaude's simplicity goals

---

## Core Patterns Update ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Improvements

- ✅ Created properly formatted YAML without markdown-style tables
- ✅ Removed out-of-scope references (reports/tasks/checkpoints folders)
- ✅ Git conventions now detect existing patterns vs being prescriptive
- ✅ Removed hardcoded file extensions - inferred from project
- ✅ Corrected session management to use Claude Code commands (/compact, /clear)
- ✅ Listed only essential MCP servers (Context7 required, magic-mcp optional)
- ✅ Removed compression flags - focus on sub-agent delegation
- ✅ Emphasized context-aware behavior over hardcoded rules

### Format Decision

Stayed with YAML to maintain compatibility with SuperClaude's @include system and existing template infrastructure.

## Phase 1 Final Iteration: Practical Minimalism ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### User Feedback Patterns Applied

- ✅ Added explicit programming principles (KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID)
- ✅ Removed theoretical concepts (timelines, metrics)
- ✅ Expanded practical tool detection (mise, asdf, brew, etc.)
- ✅ Added anti-pattern acknowledgment and avoidance
- ✅ Clarified combines_personas references valid SuperClaude personas
- ✅ Emphasized package installation approach (ask human first)
- ✅ Added pre-commit hook and git push best practices

### Philosophy Established

**Practical Minimalism** - Focus on real-world development patterns, explicit principles, and quality over metrics. SimpleClaude adapts to projects rather than prescribing rules.

---

## Phase 2.1: Command Scaffolding ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Commands Created

- ✅ `/sc-create` - Universal creation (spawn, task, build, design, document, dev-setup)
- ✅ `/sc-modify` - Intelligent modifications (improve, migrate, cleanup, deploy, refactor)
- ✅ `/sc-understand` - Comprehensive analysis (load, analyze, explain, estimate, index)
- ✅ `/sc-fix` - Focused problem resolution (troubleshoot, git fixes, error resolution)
- ✅ `/sc-review` - Quality assurance (review, scan, test)

### Key Implementation Details

- ✅ Strategic @include directives for minimal context loading
- ✅ Natural language parsing foundation in each command
- ✅ Intelligent routing to SuperClaude commands
- ✅ Sub-agent delegation patterns embedded
- ✅ Safety features for destructive operations
- ✅ Help and examples in each command

### Token Efficiency Achieved

- Each command loads only necessary pattern sections
- Conditional @includes based on detected intent
- Parallel sub-agent processing for large operations
- Smart caching strategies included

### Ready for Next Sub-Phase

Phase 2.2 - Natural Language Parsing implementation

---

## Phase 2.2: Course Correction - Routing Architecture ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Insights Learned

- ✅ **SimpleClaude is a router, not a reimplementation**
- ✅ Commands should be thin routing layers (under 100 lines)
- ✅ Use exact $ARGUMENTS pattern from SuperClaude
- ✅ Simple keyword detection, not complex NLP parsing
- ✅ Direct pass-through to SuperClaude commands
- ✅ Let SuperClaude handle all complexity
- ✅ Preserve SuperClaude's structure and patterns

### Architecture Clarification

SimpleClaude makes SuperClaude more accessible through:

- **Smart routing** - Choose the right SuperClaude command
- **Simplified interface** - Natural language instead of flags
- **Reduced commands** - 5 commands instead of 20+
- **Direct delegation** - Pass work to SuperClaude unchanged

### What SimpleClaude is NOT

- Not a rewrite of SuperClaude
- Not implementing complex logic
- Not parsing natural language deeply
- Not duplicating SuperClaude functionality

### Implementation Pattern

```yaml
# SimpleClaude command structure
1. Load minimal patterns (@include) 2. Basic keyword detection 3. Route to appropriate SuperClaude command 4. Pass $ARGUMENTS directly 5. Let SuperClaude do the work
```

### This insight fundamentally shapes all future phases

## Phase 2.5: Natural Language Intelligence ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Major Simplification Achievement

#### YAML Consolidation

- ✅ **mode-detection.yml**: Simplified from 465 lines to 126 lines, removed all JavaScript pseudo-code
- ✅ **core-patterns.yml**: Removed 775 lines (78% reduction!), eliminated duplicate mode detection
- ✅ **workflows.yml**: Reduced by 73 lines, aligned with 3-mode system
- ✅ **Overall**: Removed ~850+ lines of unnecessary complexity

#### 3-Mode System Implementation

- ✅ Converted from 8-mode system to 3 core modes:
  - **Planner**: Research-focused, asks clarifying questions, thorough analysis
  - **Implementer**: Action-oriented, makes decisions quickly, focuses on implementation
  - **Tester**: Quality-focused, emphasizes best practices, QA, and security
- ✅ Added workflow modifiers (watch, interactive, tdd) that enhance any mode
- ✅ Created legacy mapping for backward compatibility

#### Command Standardization

- ✅ Created TEMPLATE.md with simplified structure (54 lines)
- ✅ Updated sc-create.md as gold standard (66 lines)
- ✅ Aligned all 5 commands with template:
  - sc-create.md: ~66 lines
  - sc-modify.md: ~60 lines
  - sc-fix.md: ~60 lines
  - sc-review.md: ~60 lines
  - sc-understand.md: ~60 lines
- ✅ Fixed all @include paths to use shared/simpleclaude/ prefix
- ✅ Total reduction: From ~800 lines to ~300 lines across all commands (62.5% reduction)

### Key Improvements

- Pure YAML patterns without scripts or pseudo-code
- Natural language detection through simple pattern matching
- Consistent structure across all commands
- Practical minimalism achieved

### Philosophy Validation

- SimpleClaude now truly embodies "Surface Simplicity, Deep Power"
- Commands are intuitive and self-documenting
- Zero configuration required for basic usage
- Advanced features accessible through natural language
