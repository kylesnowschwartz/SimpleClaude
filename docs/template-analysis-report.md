# SimpleClaude Template Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully created a reusable template for SimpleClaude commands based on
SuperClaude's excellent patterns. The template maintains SuperClaude's quality
and evidence-based approach while consolidating functionality into 5 powerful
natural language commands.

## Template Structure Analysis

### Key Components Created

1. **TEMPLATE.md** - Universal command template featuring:

   - Clear purpose statement
   - @include directives for shared context
   - $ARGUMENTS natural language processing
   - Evidence-based standards enforcement
   - Flexible mode/feature sections
   - Consistent execution patterns

2. **simpleclaude-core.yml** - Core configuration including:

   - Simplified philosophy maintaining quality
   - Evidence standards from SuperClaude
   - Natural language task management
   - Intelligent context awareness
   - Universal flag integration

3. **simpleclaude-workflows.yml** - Command-specific workflows:
   - Dev workflow (create/build/implement)
   - Fix workflow (debug/troubleshoot/resolve)
   - Review workflow (analyze/audit/assess)
   - Deploy workflow (release/publish/ship)
   - Learn workflow (explain/understand/teach)

## Pattern Analysis from SuperClaude

### Retained Excellence

- Evidence-based decision making
- Structured symbol usage (→|&|:|»)
- TodoWrite() for complex tasks
- Git integration and safety
- MCP tool integration patterns
- Quality standards and validation

### Simplified Aspects

- 5 commands vs 18 commands
- Natural language $ARGUMENTS vs explicit flags
- Consolidated workflows vs specialized personas
- Unified approach vs mode-specific commands

## Missing Resources Identified

### Required Shared Files

1. **simpleclaude-mcp.yml** - MCP tool integration patterns
2. **simpleclaude-git.yml** - Git workflow standards
3. **simpleclaude-security.yml** - Security and validation rules
4. **simpleclaude-efficiency.yml** - Token optimization patterns

### Command Files Needed

1. **/dev.md** - Development command
2. **/fix.md** - Debugging command
3. **/review.md** - Analysis command
4. **/deploy.md** - Deployment command
5. **/learn.md** - Learning command

## Actionable Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Create the 5 command files using TEMPLATE.md
2. Populate each with command-specific content
3. Define Command_Specific_Workflow sections
4. Create missing shared YAML files

### Implementation Approach

1. Each command should:

   - Use natural language parsing of $ARGUMENTS
   - Include all relevant SuperClaude capabilities
   - Maintain evidence-based standards
   - Support universal flags (--magic, --c7, --pup)

2. Workflow consolidation mapping:
   - /dev: build + create + test + analyze patterns
   - /fix: debug + analyze + scan + test patterns
   - /review: analyze + scan + profile + security patterns
   - /deploy: build + test + deploy + monitor patterns
   - /learn: explain + document + mentor patterns

### Quality Maintenance

1. Evidence requirements on all claims
2. Clean code generation (no comments)
3. Git safety and checkpoint system
4. Progressive complexity handling
5. Session awareness and learning

## Template Usage Example

For creating /dev.md:

```markdown
**Purpose**: Universal development command for building anything

---

@include shared/simpleclaude-core.yml#Core_Philosophy

## Command Execution

Execute: immediate. --plan→show plan first Legend: Generated based on symbols
used in command Purpose: "Develop $ARGUMENTS"

Build any feature, system, or component described in $ARGUMENTS using
evidence-based development practices.

@include shared/simpleclaude-core.yml#Evidence_Standards

Examples:

- `/dev user authentication system` - Build complete auth
- `/dev React dashboard --magic` - Create UI with Magic
- `/dev API endpoints --c7` - Build with documentation

**Feature Development:** Requirements analysis | Clean implementation | Test
coverage | Git workflow **System Building:** Architecture design | Component
creation | Integration | Validation **Enhancement Mode:** Analyze existing |
Plan improvements | Implement changes | Verify

**Intelligent Detection:** Automatically identifies project type from $ARGUMENTS
| Selects appropriate stack | Follows conventions

**--watch:** Continuous build | Hot reload | Test runner **--interactive:**
Guided development | Step confirmation | Iterative refinement

@include shared/simpleclaude-core.yml#Task_Management

@include shared/simpleclaude-workflows.yml#Dev_Workflow

@include shared/simpleclaude-core.yml#Output_Organization
```

## Conclusion

SimpleClaude successfully adopts SuperClaude's excellence while simplifying to 5
natural language commands. The template provides a consistent, high-quality
foundation that maintains evidence-based standards and intelligent automation
while being more approachable through natural language interaction.
