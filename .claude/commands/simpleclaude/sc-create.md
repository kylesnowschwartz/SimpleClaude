**Purpose**: Smart creation router for any development need

---

## Command: /sc-create $ARGUMENTS

Creates anything from components to complete systems using intelligent workflow
detection.

## Smart Detection & Routing

```yaml
Project/App: [project, app, application, platform, system, microservice]
  → Full scaffold: structure, config, dependencies, tests, README

API/Backend: [api, REST, GraphQL, endpoint, route, controller, backend]
  → Complete API: routes, validation, business logic, OpenAPI docs, tests

Component/UI: [component, UI, interface, frontend, page, view, widget]
  → Smart generation: follows patterns, includes styles, state, props, tests

Documentation: [documentation, readme, docs, guide, manual, spec]
  → Analyzes code → generates appropriate format with examples

Architecture: [architecture, design, schema, diagram, structure]
  → System design: patterns, diagrams, service boundaries, contracts

DevOps: [environment, setup, docker, CI/CD, pipeline, deploy]
  → Full automation: containers, configs, scripts, workflows

Code: [function, class, module, method, utility, helper]
  → Clean code with tests, follows project conventions
```

## Examples That Show The Magic

```bash
/sc-create user authentication API
→ Builds complete REST API with JWT auth, validation, tests, OpenAPI docs

/sc-create e-commerce platform with Stripe
→ Scaffolds full app: API, database, payments, frontend, tests, deployment

/sc-create react component for user profile
→ Analyzes existing patterns → generates component, styles, state, tests

/sc-create API documentation
→ Scans codebase → generates OpenAPI spec, examples, auth guide

/sc-create microservice architecture
→ Designs service boundaries, API contracts, deployment strategy
```

## Core Workflows

**Project**: Analyze stack → Structure → Dependencies → Git init → Tests →
README

**API**: Design endpoints → Routes → Validation → Logic → Docs → Tests

**Component**: Check patterns → Generate → Style → State → Test → Index

**Documentation**: Analyze code → Extract APIs → Format → Examples → Guides

## Sub-Agent Delegation

```yaml
When: Complex multi-part tasks | Parallel work | Specialized expertise
How: Research → Design → Build | Multiple builders in parallel
Examples:
  - OAuth: Research agent → Builder agent → Test agent
  - Multiple APIs: Parallel builder agents
  - System design: Architecture → Documentation
```

## Flags

- `--plan` Show plan first | `--test` Include tests | `--tdd` Test-driven
- `--magic` UI generation | `--minimal` Simplest version | `--style` Match
  existing

## Best Practices

1. Be specific about what to create
2. SimpleClaude analyzes context and patterns
3. Always includes tests and documentation
4. Follows existing project conventions
5. Asks clarifying questions when ambiguous
