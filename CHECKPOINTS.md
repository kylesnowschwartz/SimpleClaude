# SimpleClaude Development Checkpoints

## Phase 1: Setup Simple-Claude Structure ✅
**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ Created SimpleClaude directory structure with clear namespace separation
- ✅ Consolidated 24+ SuperClaude YAML files into 4 focused SimpleClaude files (~80% reduction)
- ✅ Created SIMPLE.md configuration under 1000 tokens (achieved: ~850 tokens)
- ✅ Simplified 9 personas into 3 adaptive modes (Planner, Implementer, Tester)
- ✅ Preserved @include reference system for compatibility
- ✅ Established `sc-` prefix convention for commands
- ✅ Created foundation for natural language command interface
- ✅ Maintained all essential SuperClaude functionality

### Files Created:
- `.claude/SIMPLE.md` - Main configuration
- `.claude/commands/simpleclaude/README.md` - Command documentation
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/core-patterns.yml` - Essential patterns
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/modes.yml` - 3 adaptive modes
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/workflows.yml` - Common workflows
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/context-detection.yml` - Smart defaults
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/README.md` - Pattern documentation

### Technical Decisions:
- Used sub-agents for high-context YAML consolidation work
- Maintained backward compatibility with SuperClaude patterns
- Focused on token efficiency through strategic consolidation
- Created clear separation between SimpleClaude and user customizations

### Ready for Next Phase:
Foundation established for creating 5 consolidated commands that route to existing SuperClaude logic.

## Core Patterns Update ✅
**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ Created properly formatted YAML without markdown-style tables
- ✅ Removed out-of-scope references (reports/tasks/checkpoints folders)
- ✅ Git conventions now detect existing patterns vs being prescriptive
- ✅ Removed hardcoded file extensions - inferred from project
- ✅ Corrected session management to use Claude Code commands (/compact, /clear)
- ✅ Listed only essential MCP servers (Context7 required, magic-mcp optional)
- ✅ Removed compression flags - focus on sub-agent delegation
- ✅ Emphasized context-aware behavior over hardcoded rules

### Format Decision:
Stayed with YAML to maintain compatibility with SuperClaude's @include system and existing template infrastructure.
