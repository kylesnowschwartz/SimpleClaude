# SimpleClaude Development Checkpoints

## Phase 1: Setup Simple-Claude Structure ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Achievements

- ✅ Created SimpleClaude directory structure with clear namespace separation
- ✅ Consolidated 24+ SuperClaude YAML files into 4 focused SimpleClaude files
  (~80% reduction)
- ✅ Created SIMPLE.md configuration under 1000 tokens (achieved: ~850 tokens)
- ✅ Simplified 9 personas into 3 adaptive modes (Planner, Implementer, Tester)
- ✅ Preserved @include reference system for compatibility
- ✅ Established `sc-` prefix convention for commands
- ✅ Created foundation for natural language command interface
- ✅ Maintained all essential SuperClaude functionality

### Files Created

- `.claude/SIMPLE.md` - Main configuration
- `.claude/commands/simpleclaude/README.md` - Command documentation
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/core-patterns.yml` - Essential patterns
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/modes.yml` - 3 adaptive modes
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/workflows.yml` - Common workflows
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/context-detection.yml` - Smart defaults
- `.claude/shared/simpleclaude/README.md` - Pattern documentation

### Technical Decisions

- Used sub-agents for high-context YAML consolidation work
- Maintained backward compatibility with SuperClaude patterns
- Focused on token efficiency through strategic consolidation
- Created clear separation between SimpleClaude and user customizations

### Ready for Next Phase

Foundation established for creating 5 consolidated commands that route to
existing SuperClaude logic.

## Phase 1 Iteration: Feedback Implementation ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Feedback Addressed

- ✅ Fixed YAML syntax - removed markdown tables, ensured proper formatting
- ✅ Removed out-of-scope documentation references (reports/tasks/checkpoints)
- ✅ Git conventions now detect existing patterns rather than prescribe
- ✅ File extensions inferred from project context, not hardcoded
- ✅ Session management corrected to use Claude Code commands (/compact, /clear)
- ✅ MCP servers simplified to Context7 (essential) and magic-mcp (optional)
- ✅ Removed compression flags in favor of sub-agent delegation
- ✅ Shifted philosophy to "adapt don't prescribe"

### Key Improvements

- All YAML files now have proper, parseable syntax
- Patterns focus on smart detection over configuration
- Reduced configuration overhead
- Better alignment with SimpleClaude's simplicity goals

## Core Patterns Update ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Key Improvements

- ✅ Created properly formatted YAML without markdown-style tables
- ✅ Removed out-of-scope references (reports/tasks/checkpoints folders)
- ✅ Git conventions now detect existing patterns vs being prescriptive
- ✅ Removed hardcoded file extensions - inferred from project
- ✅ Corrected session management to use Claude Code commands (/compact, /clear)
- ✅ Listed only essential MCP servers (Context7 required, magic-mcp optional)
- ✅ Removed compression flags - focus on sub-agent delegation
- ✅ Emphasized context-aware behavior over hardcoded rules

### Format Decision

Stayed with YAML to maintain compatibility with SuperClaude's @include system
and existing template infrastructure.

## Phase 1 Final Iteration: Practical Minimalism ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### User Feedback Patterns Applied

- ✅ Added explicit programming principles (KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID)
- ✅ Removed theoretical concepts (timelines, metrics)
- ✅ Expanded practical tool detection (mise, asdf, brew, etc.)
- ✅ Added anti-pattern acknowledgment and avoidance
- ✅ Clarified combines_personas references valid SuperClaude personas
- ✅ Emphasized package installation approach (ask human first)
- ✅ Added pre-commit hook and git push best practices

### Philosophy Established

**Practical Minimalism** - Focus on real-world development patterns, explicit
principles, and quality over metrics. SimpleClaude adapts to projects rather
than prescribing rules.

## Phase 2.1: Command Scaffolding ✅

**Completed: 2025-07-06**

### Commands Created

- ✅ `/sc-create` - Universal creation (spawn, task, build, design, document,
  dev-setup)
- ✅ `/sc-modify` - Intelligent modifications (improve, migrate, cleanup,
  deploy, refactor)
- ✅ `/sc-understand` - Comprehensive analysis (load, analyze, explain,
  estimate, index)
- ✅ `/sc-fix` - Focused problem resolution (troubleshoot, git fixes, error
  resolution)
- ✅ `/sc-review` - Quality assurance (review, scan, test)

### Key Implementation Details

- ✅ Strategic @include directives for minimal context loading
- ✅ Natural language parsing foundation in each command
- ✅ Intelligent routing to SuperClaude commands
- ✅ Sub-agent delegation patterns embedded
- ✅ Safety features for destructive operations
- ✅ Help and examples in each command

### Token Efficiency Achieved

- Each command loads only necessary pattern sections
- Conditional @includes based on detected intent
- Parallel sub-agent processing for large operations
- Smart caching strategies included

### Ready for Next Sub-Phase

Phase 2.2 - Natural Language Parsing implementation
