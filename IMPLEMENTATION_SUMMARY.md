# SimpleClaude Core Patterns Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully evaluated and implemented feedback on the SimpleClaude core-patterns.yml file, addressing all 8 identified issues.

## Format Decision

**Stayed with YAML** for the following reasons:
- Maintains compatibility with SuperClaude's @include system
- Consistent with existing template infrastructure
- Supports structured data with clear hierarchy
- Already familiar to the SimpleClaude architecture

## Files Created/Updated

### 1. core-patterns.yml
- ✅ Proper YAML syntax (removed markdown tables)
- ✅ Removed out-of-scope references (reports/tasks/checkpoints)
- ✅ Git conventions now detect patterns vs prescribe them
- ✅ No hardcoded file extensions - project inference
- ✅ Correct Claude Code commands (/compact, /clear)
- ✅ Only essential MCP servers listed
- ✅ Focus on sub-agent delegation over compression
- ✅ Emphasized context-aware behavior

### 2. modes.yml
- Fixed markdown formatting issues
- Proper YAML structure throughout
- Clear mode definitions and blending rules
- Auto-detection and manual override patterns

### 3. workflows.yml
- Converted from markdown tables to proper YAML
- Comprehensive workflow patterns
- Sub-agent delegation examples
- Error handling strategies

### 4. context-detection.yml
- Fixed YAML formatting
- Smart detection patterns
- Project type and framework detection
- Code style inference strategies

### 5. SIMPLE.md
- Main configuration file
- Under 1000 tokens (~367 words)
- Clear, concise documentation
- Focus on discoverability

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Context-Aware Over Prescriptive**: All patterns detect and adapt rather than dictate behavior
2. **Sub-Agent Focus**: Emphasized delegation for token efficiency instead of compression flags
3. **Smart Defaults**: System infers from project context rather than requiring configuration
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity only when truly needed

## Validation

All YAML files now:
- Use proper YAML syntax without markdown formatting
- Focus on essential patterns only
- Emphasize detection over prescription
- Support SimpleClaude's philosophy of simplicity with power

## Next Steps

With core patterns properly implemented, SimpleClaude is ready for Phase 2: Consolidating commands that route to existing SuperClaude logic while providing a simpler interface.
